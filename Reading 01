Since this was the first reading assignment, I selected the article “A Five-Layered Business Intelligence Architecture” to understand how BI systems work in organizations. I learned that while many companies use BI, they often don’t get the full value because of weak system architecture. The article presents a five-layer model (data source, ETL, data warehouse, metadata, and end-user) that helps improve data quality and smooth information flow. I found it important that this framework supports multi-directional data flow, which solves issues seen in older one-way systems. Overall, I understood that having a solid BI architecture is key for accurate decisions and stronger business performance, although the framework still needs to be tested in real cases.
